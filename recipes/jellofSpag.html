  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spaghetti:</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Red bell peppers, tomatoes, scotch bonnet, and onions</strong> - for making the sauce. The habanero brings heat and spiciness to the sauce. If you're not a fan of spicy food, you can use less or omit it altogether.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Onions, garlic, and fresh ginger</strong> - add depth to the sauce
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Paprika, thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, bouillon powder, salt, and pepper</strong> - essential for flavoring the sauce.

      <strong>Broth</strong> - chicken, beef, or vegetable broth will work
    </li>

      <strong>optional</strong> - You can also add some optional veggies like peas, sweet corn, and carrots for extra color and nutrition. And if you want to make it a full meal, you can add some cooked protein of your choice, like diced chicken, shrimp, or tofu.
